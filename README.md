# Library-Manager

This is a library management system, developed with Django and Django REST Framework. 

In this Django app, users can donate books to the library, borrow books from the library and return it.

I used Swagger for documentation and Docker-compose to make deployment easier.

## How to deploy 

If you have installed Docker and Docker-compose, open the terminal in the project's folder and run this command:

`docker-compose up -d`
